= Run ARA Using Docker

Here is how to build, run and publish a Docker image for ARA and its database.

== Pre-Requisite: Install Make

You will need `make` to be available on the command line.

=== On Unix

Install the package `cmake`, `autoconf` or `build-essential`.

=== On Git for Windows

* Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/[ezwinports],
* Download `make-4.1-2-without-guile-w32-bin.zip` (get the version without guile),
* Extract the ZIP,
* Copy the contents to your `Git\mingw64\`, merging the folders, but do NOT overwrite/replace any existing files.

== Getting Started as an Ops

To run ARA, follow these simple steps:

* You will need this `docker` folder: +
  either it is already on your hard-drive, or you need to download it
* Be sure to have a version of ARA. +
  Either by building one from the sources or by downloading a pre-built one.
* Execute this command from this `docker` folder, after having replaced the `...` by the version to be run:

```shell
make run-version COMMIT_REF=...
```

If the ports 3306 and/or 8080 are not free on your machine, use this modified command, replacing 3306 and/or 8080 by the ports you would like to use:

```shell
make run-version COMMIT_REF=... SERVER_PORT=8080
```

ARA will then be accessible here (or to the port you specified instead of 8080): +
`http://localhost:8080/`

You will be able to create a demo project and play with it.

Data (database, assets from the indexed executions...) will be written to the folder `data`. +
You can delete this folder at any time to "reset" ARA; or backup it to make sure no data will be lost.

Press Ctrl+C in the command line window to stop ARA.

Note: the first time you run ARA, you will be asked to configure the SMTP server on which ARA will connect to send emails on new executions.

When complete, the configuration is stored in `data/config/application.properties`:
you will be able to change the configuration later,
or customize other applications configuration options.


== Getting Started as a Developer

When developing, you will want to rebuild Docker images and test them. +
All the above information are still valid,
but instead of using the target `run-version` with a `COMMIT_REF`,
just use the target `run` without any `COMMIT_REF`:
it will build the Docker images before running them.

The JAR from your workspace will be used to build the Docker images. +
The ara-server image will take the server/target/ara-*.jar file (which itself includes the ara-client JAR).

To build or rebuild the JAR file, just use this command:

```shell
make package-server
```

Or, to speed up the process during development:

```shell
make package-server SKIP_TESTS=true
```

== Technical Details

Here are the three components of ARA:

* The ara-server Docker image: it runs the server (both back and front parts) on port 8080,
* The ara-db Docker image: it runs the MarioDB/MySQL server on port 3306,
* The ara docker-compose script: it runs both the database and the Web server.

All Docker images' run-scripts and docker-compose script persist state to the `data` folder.

== Modifying the Docker Images

If you are developing ARA, you may need to adjust the ARA Docker images and rebuild them individually, with or without running them after build.

Here are all the available `make` targets:

* `build`:          Build ara-db & ara-server images
* `build-db`:       Build ara-db image
* `build-server`:   Build ara-server image
* `package-server`: Build the ARA JAR to be integrated into the ara-server Docker image (quite long, so it needs to be called manually, and you can speed it up with SKIP_TESTS=true)
* `push`:           Build ara-db & ara-server images and push them to Docker registry
* `push-db`:        Build and push ara-db image to Docker registry
* `push-server`:    Build and push ara-server image to Docker registry
* `run`:            Build and run ara-db & ara-server images with docker-compose
* `run-db`:         Build and run ara-db image
* `run-server`:     Build and run ara-server image
* `run-version`:    Run pre-existing ara-db & ara-server images with docker-compose (use COMMIT_REF=... to select the version to run)

Except `run-version` (which is a user-centric target), all other targets rebuild the image(s) before running it/them.

All targets are designed so that once you're done testing the image(s), just press Ctrl+C and the container(s) will be stopped and removed.

They all persist their data in `data` directly in this `docker` folder, so you can continue execution or "reset" them by deleting the folder, or even override some configuration options with the `data/config/application.properties` file.
