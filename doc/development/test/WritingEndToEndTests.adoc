= Writing end-to-end tests for ARA.

This page presents how end-to-end tests are implemented for testing ARA.

== Test stack and architecture

=== Test stack used

The end-to-end tests of ARA are based on https://cypress.io[Cypress] with the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor[cypress-cucumber-preprocessor]  which adds the Gherkin syntax
to the tests.

=== Page Object Model

The tests are based on the *Page Object Model* pattern. Basically it considers each page or page's fragment of ARA as an
object which will contain its properties and behaviors.

For example, we can take the Project list page of ARA. This page will be represented as a JavaScript module (see the
`<ARA_ROOT>/client/test/cypress/support/fragments/management-project.js` file).

This module will expose properties (its url for example) and behaviors (`containsDemoProject` for example that will check
in the page that the demo project is correctly displayed).

Using this pattern reduces complexity and links between tests. It also facilitates their maintainability by centralizing
every information about a page at the same place.

=== Folder & files architecture

The end-to-end tests are located in `<ARA_ROOT>/client/test/cypress`. It contains the following hierarchy :

* `fixtures` : Mocks of API responses used by tests
* `outputs`: All the generated outputs after test runs
** `cucumber`: The Cucumber elements for each tests
** `media`: The running tests captures
*** `videos`: The videos of the running tests
*** `snapshots`: The last snapshots before the tests endings
** `reports`: The reports
*** `json`: The JSON reports
**** `all`: All the generated JSON reports
**** `merged`: The merged JSON of all the JSON files from the `all` folder
*** `html`: An HTML report, equivalent to the merged JSON report
* `plugins` : Integrates plugins to Cypress (e.g. `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor`).
* `scenarii` : Stores all the Gherkin `.feature` files. If needed, you can also create sub-directories in it.
* `support` : Holds the tests implementation
** `fragments` : Contains all the `page objects` and modules. The name  of each file should depict correctly the
page it represents.
** `stepDefinitions` : Links Gherkin `.feature` to JavaScript code. Ideally, one file represents
one page.
** `commands.js` : Stores global commands and overloads of the Cypress module
** `index.js` : It is the entry point of Cypress

== How to launch the tests

You can either launch all the end-to-end tests with the `npm run cy:all` command, or you can add the `@wip` tag on scenario you choose in the `.feature` files and then run `npm run cy:wip`.

=== Create a specialized runner

If you want to run only the scenarios with a specific tag (like `@severity-sanity-check`), you can update the
`<ARA_ROOT>/client/package.json` with a new target (in the `scripts` part) which will have the following syntax :

`"cy:<name>": cypress run -e TAGS='<your_tag>' -e GLOB=test/cypress/\**/*.feature`

With :

* `name` the name of your target (like `wip` or `sanity` for example)
* `your_tag` the tag your target (like `@wip` or `@severity-sanity-check`)

And then, you can run it with `npm run cy:<name>`.

== How to generate reports

NOTE: Before generating any reports, make sure ARA is up and running

To generate reports, simply run one of the scripts below.
To do so: `npm run <script_name>`

* `cy:output:cleanup`: Deletes the whole `outputs` folder
* `cy:report:cleanup`: Deletes only the `reports` folder (within the `outputs` folder)
* `cy:report:generate`: Generates all the JSON reports files
* `cy:report:merge`: Merges all the JSON reports files into one single final JSON file
* `cy:report:html`: Generate an HTML report file from the previous merged JSON file

== How to write a new test for ARA

=== Create the Gherkin scenario

First you can create your scenario in the `test/cypress/scenarii` folder (either create a new file or add it to an
existing one). Feel free to see the other `.feature` files to check what are the available sentences. Create new sentences if you don't find what you're looking for.

The only required thing is to respect the Gherkin syntax (`*Given*`/`*When*`/`*Then*`).

=== Target frontend components

If you need to target specific front end components in your Gherkin sentences, you can locate them (quicktip : Find a
specific label in ARA, then search it in the client sources), and add the custom attribute `data-nrt="<your-id>"` in it.

In your JavaScript code, you'll retrieve the element with the code `cy.GetByDataNrt("<your-id>")` or
`cy.WaitForElementByDataNrt("<your-id>", timeoutValueInMs)` if your element appears dynamically.

You can check the `<ARA_ROOT>/client/src/views/management-projects.vue` file for an example.

=== Implement the Gherkin sentences

If you create your own sentences, then you'll need to implement its behavior with JavaScript.

It might help to check the already existing code in `test/cypress/support`.

NOTE: Basics of JavaScript and NodeJS are required to create end-to-end tests.

==== Link the Gherkin with the code
First, find the file in which you'll add the code (for example in `test/cypress/support/stepDefinitions/homeSteps.js` or
another file which represents the target of your sentence). It is mandatory that your file is within the folder
`test/cypress/support/stepDefinitions` and its name ends with `Steps.js`).

Then you can create the code linked to your sentence. If you create the sentence `Given an user`, then you can add the
following code :

```javascript
Given('an user', () => {

});
```

(The same applies for `When` and `Then`). If you create a new file, make sure that the first line is :
`import { Given, When, Then } from 'cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps';`

==== Add the behavior of your sentence

Once you do the step above, you can implement the behavior by using the Cypress library (see
https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html). If you need to interact with a page or a fragment of pages, make
sure to respect its POM pattern (see above), and import the corresponding `../fragments/<yourpage>` file in your `steps`
file.
