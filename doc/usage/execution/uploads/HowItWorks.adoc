# How ARA works

To understand how to upload reports on ARA, it's highly recommanded to read this part and learn how ARA works
internally.

## The Data model of ARA

ARA use a very basic data model internally :

### The Cycle

The Cycle represents a scheduled test execution on a given *Branch* (a VCS branch like a Git branch for example),
for a given *project*

For example, in the image below, the cycle `Day` represents all the executions on Develop for the Demo project
(here in red) :

image::images/cycle.png[A Cycle in ARA]

A Cycle can be linked to several Executions.

### The Execution

The Execution represents the grouping of tests for different *test types* and *countries*.

For example, an execution may contains the reports of all the Cucumber and Postman tests for a french
environment on build X of the project.
In the image below, the red part is the execution :

image::images/execution.png[An Execution in ARA]

An Execution may be composed of several Runs.

### The Run

The Run represents the execution of *one Test type* for *one given country* in an execution.

In the example below, we have two runs : `FR: Integ. APIs` and `FR: HMI Desktop` :

image::images/run.png[A Run in ARA]

A Run may be composed of several Executed Scenario.

### The Executed Scenario

The Executed Scenario represent the execution of *One test Scenario* (either a Postman collection or a Cucumber
scenario for example).

In the image below, for one run, we have one Executed Scenario passing and one Executed Scenario failing :

## The Informations files of ARA

In order to work and to know what and how to analyse, ARA will need some specific files in each reports you'll
upload.

[#cycleDefJson]
### The cycleDefinition.json

This file will describe how the given execution reports should be treated. It needs to be added at the root of
the ZIP file send to ARA to explain to the system how to rattach the reports with the teams/problems/thresholds...

It describes what the execution is *expected* to run.

Some jobs in the execution can fail to start or be skipped due to earlier failures.
With the `cycleDefinition.json` file, ARA is shielded from such missing data.

If one of the sub-jobs did not run, ARA will show a failed execution because of missing results, instead of
showing a succeed execution because no test failed.

Here is an example of one `cycleDefinition.json` file:
```json
{
  "blockingValidation": true,
  "platforms_rules": {
    "integ2": [
      {
        "blockingValidation": true,
        "country": "FR",
        "countryTags": "all,nl",
        "testTypes": "api,api-postman,firefox",
        "severityTags": "all",
        "enabled": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "qualityThresholds": {
    "high": {
      "failure": 85,
      "warning": 90
    },
    "sanity-check": {
      "failure": 90,
      "warning": 95
    },
    "medium": {
      "failure": 80,
      "warning": 85
    }
  }
}
```

In the first line of this json (`blockingValidation`), we tells to ARA that if the given quality Threshold are
not met, then a call to the API `{ara_baseurl}/api/projects/{projectCode}/executions/quality-status?jobUrl={jobUrl}`
will return `FAILED`.

The `platforms_rules` block define what to analyze or not for the given platforms (You're free to define your platform's
name -- here `integ2` -- it will be added to each run of your execution).

For each platformRule, we define if this platform should respect the threshold (`blockingValidation` - note that this
parameter may be overrided by the global one), on what country does it run (`Country`), and what are the country tags to
(`countryTags`), the test types (`testTypes`) and severities (`severityTags`) to analyze in the given report files. Those
parameters must match the values you set in your project's settings.

The `enabled` param is an easy way to disable the ARA analyze for a given platform without deleting your configuration.


The `qualityThresholds` block defines what are the threshold to use for each severity used in your project. If the
quality status of a severity for this execution is below the `warning` one, a call to the `quality-status` API will
return `WARNING`. If it's below the `failure` one, it will return `FAILED`.


[#buildInfosJson]
### The buildInformation.json

Once your analyzer is configured using the `cycleDefinition.json` file, you need to pass additional information
to your reports to link your ARA results with your CI build. This is done with the help of the
`buildInformation.json` files (yes, there is more than one, but don't worry it will not change so much).

This kind of file describes information about the job that ran either the execution, a deployment or a run
or a test-type.

We recommand that those files should be generated using your CI pipeline and not manually for production
environments.

Here is an example of a `buildInformation.json` file :
```
{
  "url": "https://build.company.com/demo/master/day/42/",
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "timestamp": 1542018261233,
  "release": "v2",
  "version": "724b1de228b72047d865d96f3c518164575caa37",
   "versionTimestamp": 1542018261233
}
```

The `url` field of this file should give a link to the build in your CI which correspond to the folder this
file is located. For example if you have a dedicated job for your FR country, it should points on it only in
the `buildInformation.json` of the FR folder. Then if you have on the same Execution, another job for your
EN country, it should points on it in the `buildInformation.json` of the EN folder.

Another example, may be a job which will build the FR country by triggering a subjob which will build a mobile
version and a subjob which will build a web version. In that case, the buildInformation.json of your FR folder
in your report will points to the FR job in your pipeline, and the buildInformation.json of your FR/mobile folder
in your report will points to the mobile subjob in your pipeline.

The `result` field should reflect the state of your CI job for this build, if it's in `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`
(note that ARA can analyze results of NRT reports even on failed CI job, you can configure it in this way if
you want).

The `timestamp` is a UNIX timestamp since Epoch which represents the date and time when this current build job
has started.

The `release` field contains the current tested release version of your application.

The  `version` field contains the current tested build version of your application.

The `versionTimestamp` is a UNIX timestamp since Epoch which represents the date and time when this current
version was tagged.

Note that the `release`, `version` and `versionTimestamp` fields are optional in the `buildInformation.json`
of a Run.
