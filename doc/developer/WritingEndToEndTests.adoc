= Writing End to End Tests for ARA.

This page presents how end to end tests are implemented for testing ARA.

== Test stack and architecture

=== Test stack used

The end-to-end tests of ARA are based on https://cypress.io[Cypress] with the
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor[cypress-cucumber-preprocessor]  which adds the Gherkin syntax
to the tests.

=== Page Object Model

The tests are based on the Page Object Model pattern. Basically it considers each Page or page's fragment of ARA as an
object which will contains its properties and its behaviors.

For exemple, we can take the Project list page of ARA. This page will be represented as a Javascript module (see the
`<ARA_ROOT>/client/test/cypress/support/fragments/management-project.js` file).

This module will expose properties (its url for example) and behaviors (`containsDemoProject` for example that will check
in the page that the demo project is correctly displayed).

Using this pattern reduces complexity and links between tests. It also facilitates their maintainability by centralizing
every information about a page at the same place.

=== Folder & Files architecture

The End-to-End tests are located in `<ARA_ROOT>/client/cypress`. It contains the following hierarchy :

* `plugins` : Use for integration of plugins for cypress (like the `cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` one).
* `scenarii` : Stores all the Gherkin `.feature` files. We can freely create sub-directories in it if you want.
* `support` : implementations of tests
** `support/fragments` : Contains all the Page objects and modules. The name  of each file should depict correctly the
page it represents.
** `support/stepDefinitions` : link between Gherkin `.feature` and Javascript code. Ideally, one file should represent
one page.
** `support/commands.js` : Global commands and overloads of Cypress module
** `support/index.js` : The entry point of Cypress

== How to launch the tests

You can either launch all the end to end tests with the command : `npm run cy:all`.

Or you can add the `@wip` tag on scenario you choose in the `.feature` files and run them with `npm run cy:wip`.

=== Create a specialized runner

If you want to run only the scenarios with a specific tag (like `@severity-sanity-check`), you can update the
`<ARA_ROOT>/client/package.json` with a new target (in the `scripts` part) which will have the following syntax :

`"cy:<name>": cypress run -e TAGS='<your_tag>' -e GLOB=test/cypress/**/*.feature`

With :
* `name` the name of your target (like `wip` or `sanity` for example)
* `your_tag` the tag your target (like `@wip` or `@severity-sanity-check`)

And then, you can run it with `npm run cy:<name>`.

== How to write a new tests for ARA

=== Create the Gherkin scenario

First you can create your scenario in the `test/cypress/scenarii` folder (either create a new file or add it to an
existing one). Don't hesitate to see the other `.feature` files to check what are the available sentences, but you can
create a sentence if you don't find the one you're looking for.

The only required thing is to respect the Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then).

=== Target Frontend components

If you need to target specific front end components in your Gherkin sentences, you can locate them (quicktip : Find a
specific label in ARA, then search it in the client sources), and add the custom attribute `data-nrt="<your-id>"` in it.

In your Javascript code, you'll retrieve the element with the code `cy.GetByDataNrt("<your-id>")` or
`cy.WaitForElementByDataNrt("<your-id>", timeoutValueInMs)` if your element appears dynamically.

You can check the `<ARA_ROOT>/client/src/views/management-projects.vue` file for an example.

=== Implement the Gherkin sentences

If you create your own sentences, then you'll need to implement the behavior of it with some javascript code.

Don't hesitate to get inspirations from already existing code in `test/cypress/support`.
NOTE: You must know the basics of javascript and NodeJS to create End-To-End tests.

==== Link the Gherkin with the code
First, find the file in which you'll add the code (for example in `test/cypress/support/stepDefinitions/homeSteps.js` or
another file which represents the target of your sentence). The mandatory fact is that your file must reside in
`test/cypress/support/stepDefinitions` and ends with `Steps.js`).

Then you'll create the code attached to your sentence. If you create the sentence `Given an user`, then you'll add the
code :

```javascript
Given('an user', () => {

});
```

(The same apply for `When` and `Then`). If you create a new file, make sure that the first line in it, is :
`import { Given, When, Then } from 'cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps';`

==== Add the behavior of your sentence

Once you do the step above, you can implement the behavior by using the Cypress lib (see
https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html). If you need to interact with page or fragment of pages, make
sure to respect the POM pattern (see above), and import the corresponding `../fragments/<yourpage>` file in your `steps`
file.
