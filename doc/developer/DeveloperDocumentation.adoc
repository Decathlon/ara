= ARA's Developer Documentation

== Getting Started in Two Minutes

Here is basically what you will need to set up on your development machine:

* *Create a database and start it:*
  ** (Optional) You can change your db root account's password in the database/instance/manage-db.sh script.
  By default it's `dev_password_to_change`.
  ** Run `./database/instance/manage-db.sh create <FOLDER_PATH_TO_PERSISTS>`
  ** Run `mvn liquibase:updateTestingRolling -Pdev -Dliquibase.database.password=<YOUR DB ACCOUNT PASS>`
* *Build the server part and start it:*
  ** Run `mvn install -Pdev` in the project's root folder to build the server and its dependencies
     (you can speed up the build by running `mvn install -Pdev -Dmaven.test.skip=true` instead but you'll
     lose your Unit tests).
  ** Run `java -Dspring.profiles.active=dev -jar server/target/ara-server-*.jar -Dspring.datasource.password=<YOUR DB ACCOUNT PASS> -Dspring.config.location=classpath:/` to launch the back-end server. +
  ** When modifying the server, just run `mvn install -Pdev` in the `server` folder to not rebuild all dependencies, this time.
* *Build the client part and start it:*
  ** Run `npm install` (this is part of the above `mvn install`, so you can skip it if you have already done that).
  ** Run `npm run dev` in the `client` folder to start the front-end server.
  ** ARA's GUI is available at http://localhost:8081 (and it connects to the back-end launched above).

More information are provided below and in linked detailed documentations.

== Technical Details of the Project

=== Modules

Follow links for module-specific documentations:

* *<<../client/README.adoc#head, client>>*: the front-end with the user experience
  (generates static files packaged as a JAR to be included in the server JAR)
* *db*: a script to create an ARA database using Docker:
  use the parameter `create` to create one database server
  with both the `ara-dev` (to run both client and server for manual tests)
  and `ara-dev-in` (for integration tests of the server project) schemas,
  or use the parameter `help` for more information about available commands
  (start, stop, destroy, mysqladmin, shell, purge)
* *doc*: <<../integrator/main/IntegratorDocumentation.adoc#head, integrator>>,
  <<../user/main/UserDocumentation.adoc#head, user>> and
  <<../developer/DeveloperDocumentation.adoc#head, developer>> documentations
* *<<../docker/README.adoc#head, docker>>*: Dockerfiles for database and server,
  as well as a docker-compose script to run ARA with no prerequisite (except docker and make)
* *generated-cucumber-report*: contains Cucumber feature files used to generate report files
  used on the server integration tests to run into all possible cases while indexing such reports
* *ide-resources*: IDE <<../ide-resources/eclipse/README.adoc#head, configuration for Eclipse>> and
  <<../ide-resources/intellij/README.adoc#head, configuration for IntelliJ>>
* *<<../server/README.adoc#head, server>>*: the back-end which handles the logic and communication with the database
  (depends on the `generated-cucumber-report` projects for integration tests,
  and includes the `client` project to only have one server to start in production)

=== How to View/Edit the Documentation

In order to edit and view rendered ASCII-arts (images with Ditaa and UML with PlantUML),
you need to download and install AsciidocFX + GraphViz: they contain all "plugins" like Ditaaa and PlantUML:

* Install AsciidocFX : +
  https://asciidocfx.com/#truehow-to-install-asciidocfx
* Install GraphViz: +
  http://www.graphviz.org/download/ +
  Choose eg. "Stable 2.38 Windows install packages"

Note: on the AsciidocFX page, you can see how to create UML, ASCII-art, directory-listing, math expressions, graphics...

You can open and edit the .adoc files with AsciidocFX.

Once AsciidocFX + GraphViz is installed, the AsciiDoc plugin in IntelliJ IDEA will display ASCII-art and
UML generated images for you without any further installation nor configuration. This is pretty neat.
