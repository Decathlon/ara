= Upload a Cucumber execution's report on ARA

Once you've got a running version of ARA, you can upload cucumber execution's
report in the system. It's highly recommended to read the
<<HowItWorks.adoc#head, How It Works>> part.

== Prepare the report

Once you launch you Cucumber runs, you have to export the result in JSON format
(which is the default export mode of Cucumber).

This report must live in a specific directory architecture which is :
`{TIMESTAMP}/{COUNTRY}/{TYPE}/report.json`

With :

* `{TIMESTAMP}` the timestamp, from the Jan 01 1970, of the moment when the test was
launched.
* `{COUNTRY}` the country code of the country tested by your run (for example `fr` if
your run has tested the France configuration). This country code must be defined in your
project's settings in ARA in the Country tab.
* `{TYPE}` the code of the typology of test this run covers (for example `firefox-web`
if your run has tested the Web configuration on your app in Firefox). This type code must
be defined in your project's settings in ARA in the Type tab.

== Add ARA specific information

You need to create a file name `cycleDefinition.json` and add it to the folder architecture
described above like so : `{TIMESTAMP}/cycleDefinition.json`

For its content, please see the explanation <<HowItWorks.adoc#cycleDefJson, here>>

You also need to add some files which will tells ARA where to find your build information
(build timestamp, build url, version...). The content of this file is described
<<HowItWorks.adoc#buildInfosJson, here>>. Please note that you'll need a `buildInformation.json`
file in each directory in the folder architecture. So you'll have at least :

* `{TIMESTAMP}/buildInformation.json`
* `{TIMESTAMP}/{COUNTRY}/buildInformation.json`
* `{TIMESTAMP}/{COUNTRY}/{TYPE}/buildInformation.json`


You highly recommand that those files (cycleDefinition and all the buildInformation files) should
be generated in a script inside your CI tool (like GitlabCI, or Jenkins) to avoid any errors, and
to retrieve the good information (buildLink, buildTimestamp...) directly in it.

== Send the report

Once all the step above are completed, you should have (at least) the following architecture :

```
{TIMESTAMP}/
   cycleDefinition.json
   buildInformation.json
   {COUNTRY}/
      buildInformation.json
      {TYPE}/
         buildInformation.json
         report.json
```

(Note that you can have several {TYPE} folders and several {COUNTRY} folders for a same {TIMESTAMP},
this is just the minimal expected by ARA).

All you have to do to make ARA analyze it is to zip this folder inside a `{TIMESTAMP}.zip` file
and send it over HTTP to ARA with the following parameters :

|===
| **URL** | `{ara_baseurl}`/api/projects/`{project_code}`/executions/upload
| **HTTP METHOD** | POST
| **CONTENT TYPE** | multipart/form-data
| **BODY PARAMS** | `branch: {{YOUR_CYCLE_BRANCH}}, cycle: {{YOUR_CYCLE_NAME}}, zip: {{YOUR_ZIP_FILE}}`
|===

For example on Postman :

image::images/upload_with_postman.png[Upload with Postman]

Or with the CURL command line :

```
curl \
  -F "branch={{YOUR_CYCLE_BRANCH}}" \
  -F "cycle={{YOUR_CYCLE_NAME}}" \
  -F "zip=@/home/user/Documents/1565177727.zip" \
  {ara_baseurl}/api/projects/{project_code}/executions/upload
```



== [OPTIONAL] Upload Cucumber stepDefinition.json file

This file is optional.
It lets users create aggregation rules matching Cucumber steps definitions (regular expressions) instead
of just steps (scenario contents).
For instance, the step `^Step number (\\d+)$` can be used in a scenario as `Step number 1` and `Step number 2`.
If both steps fail, it could be because the step definition is erroneous, and users would want to create a problem with
just one rule aggregating both step "instances".
If the file is not provided, ARA will threat numbers and double-quoted strings in steps as parameters and will thus try
to guess what were the underlying step definitions.
But this is very basic, error-prone, and don't account for more complex regular expressions.
By extracting a `stepDefinitions.json` array file, you will be assured that ARA will let users create relevant rules.

If you decide to provide this file, it must contain a JSON array of all step definitions glue used by a Cucumber run.
For example:

```json
[
  "^A step$",
  "^A step with number (\\d+) parameter$",
  "^A step with string \"([^\"]*)\" parameter$",
]
```

=== How to extract the stepDefinition.json
In Java, just include the `ara-lib` library to your test project.
Here is how to find it with Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.decathlon.ara</groupId>
    <artifactId>ara-lib</artifactId>
    <version>${ara.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

The library declares the cucumber dependency as provided: you will need a working Cucumber dependency in your project
for the extractor to work: it will need to access your glue code.

Then, use the `com.decathlon.ara.lib.StepDefinitionExtractor` class like this:

```java
String outputDirectory = System.getProperty("user.dir"); // Create stepDefinitions.json in the current directory
String gluePackage = "com.company.project.tests.cucumber.glue"; // Base package containing all @Given, @When, @Then...
StepDefinitionExtractor.extract(outputDirectory, gluePackage);
```

If you have made an implementation of StepDefinitionExtractor for another language/Cucumber-flavour,
we would be glad to include it in the open-source repository of ARA :-)
