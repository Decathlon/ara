= ARA - HTML Email Templates

This folder uses the same file names as in `ara/client/src/components/nrt-*.vue` to easily compare two files, i.e. _VueJS GUI_ with _Thymeleaf mail_.

Although the comparison had to be done manually, this remains the least painful way to make sure evolutions are adopted both in the client view and in the HTML mails. The use of Thymeleaf also helps by having roughly the same VueJS syntax-philosophy (e.g. `v-if` vs. `th:if` ...).

NOTE: `favicon.png` is also duplicated from the client project.
