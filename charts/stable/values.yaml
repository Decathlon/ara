api:

        # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
        # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
        # limits:
        #  cpu: 100m
        #  memory: 128Mi
        # requests:
        #  cpu: 100m
