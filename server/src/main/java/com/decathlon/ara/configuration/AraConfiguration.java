/**
 * <p>ARA's application configuration options to be used by the Java code.</p>
 * <p>
 * Note: every property needs to be documented with javadoc (it is a public interface to be used by customers):
 * Spring will automatically generate target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json
 * for IDEs to auto-complete and document the application*.properties configuration files
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Important: if you define a new configuration key but only use it in @Value("${ara.foo-bar}")
 * then you need to document the new keys in src/main/resources/META-INF/additional-spring-configuration-metadata.json
 * Spring will embed it in the generated spring-configuration-metadata.json for IDE auto-completion.
