== What is ARA?

ARA helps you to fight against regressions by letting it preanalyze your non-regression tests runs,
tracks and follows problems, keep their history, and even break your CI build if quality isn't
met.

== How to locally install it

If you just want to install it locally to give it a try, you can !
Also, after this installation, you can follow up the <<doc/demo/DemoWalkthrough.adoc#head, Demo walkthrough>>
to explore ARA features !!

Please note the following :

* You'll need https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker]
* All the datas that you import in ARA won't be persisted.
* The port 3306 and 8080 must be available locally.

=== I've got a Windows PC !

1. Open a Powershell Command Prompt
2. Run the command `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decathlon/ara/master/docker-compose.yml`
3. Run the command `docker-compose pull`
4. Run the command `docker-compose up`
5. Open up a browser on `http://localhost:8080`
6. Enjoy !
7. To stop it, in the command line, just do a `docker-compose down` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`
8. To restart it, in the command line do a `docker-compose up` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`


=== I've got a Mac (or a GNU/Linux PC) !

1. Open a Terminal
2. Run the command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decathlon/ara/master/docker-compose.yml`
3. Run the command `docker-compose pull`
4. Run the command `docker-compose up`
5. Open up a browser on `http://localhost:8080`
6. Enjoy !
7. To stop it, in the command line, just do a `docker-compose down` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`
8. To restart it, in the command line do a `docker-compose up` in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml`

== How to install it on my Infrastructure

This kind of install is recommanded if you want a Production environment for ARA and your projects.
Unfortunatelly for now, we only support GNU/Linux based machine for this kind of installation
(but if you want to contribute, be our guest ! :D ).

The limitation is due to the fact that volume mounting with Docker on Windows can be quite buggy from a machine to
another, and the mounting is necessary to persist ARA datas and recover them on server restart.

You can find the full installation procedure <<doc/integrator/main/IntegratorDocumentation.adoc#head, here, in the
Integrator Documentation>>

== How to Use ARA?

You can go through the <<doc/demo/DemoWalkthrough.adoc#head, Demo Walkthrough>> to quickly learn how to
use ARA.

You can also read the <<doc/user/main/UserDocumentation.adoc#head, User Documentation>> to learn everything
you need to know about the utilization of ARA (don't hesitate to pass those doc to the rest of your teams ;) ).

== How to Develop on ARA?

Please read the <<doc/developer/DeveloperDocumentation.adoc#head, Developer Documentation>>
to learn how the project is structured and how to develop new features in ARA and/or contribute.
