== What is ARA?

ARA helps you to fight against regressions by letting it preanalyze your non-regression tests runs,
tracks and follows problems, keep their history, and even break your CI build if quality isn't
met.

== How to locally install it

If you just want to install it locally to give it a try, you can !
Also, after this installation, you can follow up the <<doc/demo/DemoWalkthrough.adoc#head, Demo walkthrough>>
to explore ARA features !!

Please note the following :

* You'll need https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker]
* All the datas that you import in ARA won't be persisted.
* The port 7000, 9000, 5432 must be available locally.
* Add to `/etc/hosts` (Linux OS) or to `/private/etc/hosts` (MacOS) `127.0.0.1 oauth2.dev.localhost`

=== I've got a Windows PC !

1. Open a Powershell Command Prompt
2. Run the command `Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile docker compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decathlon/ara/main/code/docker-compose.yaml`
3. Run the command `docker compose up`
4. Open up a browser on `http://127.0.0.1:7000`
5. Enjoy !
6. To stop it, in the command line, just do a `docker compose down` in the same directory as the `docker compose.yaml`
7. To restart it, in the command line do a `docker compose up` in the same directory as the `docker compose.yaml`


=== I've got a Mac !

1. Open a Terminal
2. Run the command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decathlon/ara/main/code/docker-compose.yaml`
3. Run the command `docker compose up`
4. Open up a browser on `http://127.0.0.1:7000`
5. Enjoy !

== How to install it on my Infrastructure

ARA has a Helm chart to easily install it in a Kubernetes Cluster.

* Add the ara repository if not already added:

```shell
helm repo add ara https://decathlon.github.io/ara/
```

* Update repositories

```shell
helm repo update
```

* Install it with custom values

```shell
helm install -f values.yaml --create-namespace --namespace ara my-ara ara/ara
```

A sample `values.yaml` could be like this one:

```yaml
api:
  authentication: oauth2-github # Put a friendly value to disable default authentication
  customConfig:
    # Active providers
    # provider-type has to be one of custom / github / google
    # code refers to the provider key ( spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.<code>)
    oauth2providers:
      conf:
      - display-name: Github
        provider-type: github
        code: github

    # Oauth
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          # >> the authorization_code conf
          client:
            registration:
              # fed
              github:
                clientId: YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
                clientSecret: YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET
                redirect-uri: "${ara.clientBaseUrl}/${ara.loginProcessingUrl}/{registrationId}"

```
